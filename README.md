# Full-Stack-Data-Management-Application
Responsive Full-Stack Data Management Application with MongoDB & Express.js  
I developed a responsive web application that enables seamless data management with full CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations.This project combines:  
âœ… HTML & CSS for a clean and responsive front end  
âœ… Express.js & Node.js for a scalable back end  
âœ… MongoDB** for efficient database handling  

ðŸ”¹ The app simplifies data management with an intuitive UI, real-time updates, and smooth interactions.
